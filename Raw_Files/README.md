# IThinkYouShouldLists
### Right, okay. So the way I pictured it...
<p>A few months back, I was working on a project in my role as a security engineer and was presented with a task that involved creating synthetic log events, but masking any PII from the actual logs. Naturally, I felt it was my civic duty to replace any actual employee names or domains with names and organizations from the greatest sketch comedy show of this century; _I Think You Should Leave_ with Tim Robinson. After manually entering these names for a while, I decided it would be in my best interest to clug a few cans and watch the first two seasons of _ITYSL_ with closed captions and document all the characters and places from this fictional universe.</p>
<p>Aside from this broad mission, when it comes to GitHub, I have no idea what this s**t is, and I'm f***ing scared. So as a secondary motive, I hope to use this repo as an opportunity to better familiarize myself with the platform and best practices and methodology for Git. My apologies in advance if I break this entire repo one day from trying to figure out how to perform proper version control.</p>

### What's the next wild thing we're gonna do?
- I started this project well aware that Season 3 was on the horizon, so part of my education would indeed be to use proper CI/CD practices to update this repo with Season 3 characters and places. Look for this update once I re-gain a consistent method of streaming Netflix.
- One of my original intentions was to also create a quote generator, but honestly the good people at [I Think You Should Quote](https://ithinkyoushouldquote.me/) seem to have that under control, so definitely give that a look.
- Depending how bored and how much free time I get, I'm not opposed to including some of the other shows from the Tim Robinson Extended Universe (e.g. _Detroiters_, _The Characters_, other assorted sketches).
- I also occasionally try to build programs with other languages (namely Python, Bash, PowerShell, assorted querying languages), so I may try to update this repository with some of those as well.
  
### We're all trying to find the guy who did this!
Not sure if it goes without saying this, but this is purely a fan project, and I have no affiliation with the talented people at Netflix, Lonely Island, Irony Point, Kanin Corp, or Corncob TV. I'm just here for the zipline.

### I don't know what is going on...
V1.0...
