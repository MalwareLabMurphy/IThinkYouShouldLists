# Locations and Businesses
### A lot of these places, they try and rip off people like me...
<p>A running list of the businesses, physical locations, aggressive retail stores, and one university name-dropped throughout ITYSL. I did my best to avoid IRL businesses or places where possible, but would not rule out a few slipping in just out of their sheer importance to the ITYSL universe. These lists should be handy for providing fake or dummy values for business names or web domains, in case you're like Herbie Hancock and love to lie. A table with the file descriptions and string permutations is provided below.</p>

| File | Permutations | Description |
| ---- | ------------ | ----------- |
| business\_name | N/A | Full names of the businesses as mentioned in ITYSL with all spaces and special characters intact. |
| domain | lower(business/place\_name), remove all spaces and special characters | A list of the businesses and places formatted so they could be used for fake website or email domains. |
| place\_name | N/A |Full names of the locations as mentioned in ITYSL with all spaces and special characters intact. |
