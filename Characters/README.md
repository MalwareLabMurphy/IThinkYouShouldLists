# The Characters
### They're not, like, real people, kinda...
<p>Here it is; the meat and potatoes of this project. Providing lists of all the characters from ITYSL in varying formats that could be used for populating users in virtual environments, masking sensitive personal info for demonstrations, or even naming the next Baby of the Year. I'll update the table below with details of the different permutations used to create each wordlist.</p>

| File | Permutations | Description |
| ---- | ------------ | ----------- |
| \_full\_name | N/A | The full name as portrayed in ITYSL, to include nicknames in quotations. |
| email | lower(first\_name) + "." + lower(last\_name) | Names presented in a "firstname.lastname" format, as is often seen in corporate email convention. |
| first\_last\_name | first\_name + \\s + last\_name | Just the characters' first and last names, without middle name or nicknames where applicable. |
| username | left(lower(first\_name), 1) + lower(last\_name) | Turning the names into a "first initial, last name" style string commonly seen as OS usernames. |
